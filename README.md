A blog where only members are allowed to view the content. 
Tools and technologies: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap...
Users can register an account which is authenticated using MySQL in phpmyadmin of a XAMPP server. 
The passwords are encrypted using the BCRYPT method, which uses the Blowfish algorithm to create hashes for each password. 
Furthermore, I have used PHPMailer to create a secure path for sending emails by using PHP code.

The website is deployed with Heroku. However there is no added SQL database, so the login and register functions will not work properly.
